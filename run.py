"""
RUN SCRIPT - Start the J.A.R.V.I.S server
=======================================

PURPOSE:
- Single entry point to start the backend. Run this once per user/machine;
  the server then handles all chat and realtime requests for that instance.

WHAT IT DOES:
- Imports the FastAPI app from app.main.
- Runs it with uvicorn on host 0.0.0.0 (accept connections from any interface)
  and port 8000.
- reload=True means any change to Python files will restart the server
  (handy for development).

USAGE:
    python run.py

Then open http://localhost:8000 in the browser, or use the API from another app.
API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

NOTE:
- Before running, set GROQ_API_KEY (and optionally TAVILY_API_KEY for realtime search) in .env.

import uvicorn

# =========================================================
# ENTRY POINT
# =========================================================
# Only run uvicorn when this file is executed directly (python run.py),
# not when it is imported by another module.
# =========================================================

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(
        "app.main:app",   # String path to the FastAPI app instance (module:variable).
        host="0.0.0.0",   # Listen on all network interfaces so other devices can connect.
        port=8000,        # HTTP port; change if 8000 is already in use.
        reload=True       # Auto-restart when .py files change (useful during development).
    )
